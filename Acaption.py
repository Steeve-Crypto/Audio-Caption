Creating a complete code to generate captions from an audio file 
involves several complex steps, including speech recognition and 
natural language processing. 
Using the SpeechRecognition library, which utilizes 
Google's Web Speech API to perform speech recognition and generate captions. 
May require an internet connection as it uses an online API.

    recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
    
    try:
        with sr.AudioFile(audio_file_path) as source:
            audio_data = recognizer.record(source)  # Record the audio from the file
            
            # Recognize the speech using Google Web Speech API
            caption = recognizer.recognize_google(audio_data)
            return caption
    except sr.UnknownValueError:
        return "Could not understand the audio"
    except sr.RequestError as e:
        return f"Error in accessing the Google Web Speech API: {e}"
